    <p>The following symbol is supposed to be a left double quotation mark (Hex UTF-8 bytes 0xE2 0x80 0x9C): â€œ</p>
    <p>The detection fails on Firefox with Apache 2 serving the file and the symbol is rendered incorrectly. Works on Chrome and WebKit2</p>
    <p>Firefox, chrome and WebKit all fail to detect that this is an XHTML file due to the wrong mimetype being sent by the webserver (due to the wrong file extension).</p>
