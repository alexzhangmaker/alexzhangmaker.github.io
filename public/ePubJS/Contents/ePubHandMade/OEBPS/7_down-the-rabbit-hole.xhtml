  <h1>Lark the Rabbit Hole</h1>
  I just started to implement such a tool in Java (OpenJDK compatible): html2epub. In order to get rid of manually editing the config file, I'll probably start a separate tool to generate the config file from any given directory (however, it would still be necessary to determine the order of the XHTMLs in the EPUB - for non-programmatical use, developing a GUI helper tool could be considered, for a fully flexible programmatical solution, I haven't come up with an idea yet). Before that, I implemented shell script based converters for custom XML input (hag2epub tools) - in case you're interested, I would probably port them to XHTML input (with a config file for the EPUB metadata or obtaining metadata from the topmost index.html of a directory, if existing).
